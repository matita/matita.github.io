title: How I set up my blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---



I spent some time trying to understand which should be the best choice for me to start writing a blog.  

I used to have a WordPress blog on my personal web site, but there were some points that I didn't like:
- it is slow
- it is vulnerable (it was infected two times and I had to recover some custom work I did on it)
- you have to update it regularly to have the latest security fixes, but the last time I did a big update I had to throw away the theme that I had set up
- it is annoying to backup it

So I started to look around at the different options I had.

I was most attracted by WordPress.com, Tumblr and Medium, but the fact that I don't own every single piece of my blog kind of disturbed me; I want to be able to edit everything my readers see (appearance, interaction, ...), and the fences of a third party service don't fit my needs.

So I chose maybe the most natural choice for a developer: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Here are the steps I've done to install it.


## Install Jekyll

I still haven't do it. I found a solution that didn't force me to install anything on my computer and I am super-happy for this.


## Fork Lanyon theme on GitHub

After spending some time searching some beautiful theme for my blog (because of Medium I cannot stand sidebars anymore, and most of Jekyll themes seem like late 90s websites...) I came across the wonderful [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/)
