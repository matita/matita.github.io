title: Head of Frontend Development
---

The time has come.  
That dreadful time that marked the end of coding in my career.  
I am now the the Head of Frontend Development.

## What does it mean?
I still have to figure it out completely, for sure it means much more things to do, most of them not code related.

Mostly dealing with people, making sure they are motivated and focused on the right things, and ensuring the quality of the products is always high.

## Am I ready?
Yes.  
If I wasn't my employers wouldn't have promoted me.  
Furthermore, it's quite some months that I'm doing kinda the same job, only the name of the position is changed.

## Ok, but am I actually ready?
Weeeeell...  
The impostor sindrome is behind the corner and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.  
For sure there are still a lot of things that I have to learn, but I'm taking it as a new challenge, probably the first real challenge in a while.

I know for a fact that I'm still making mistakes, but I need to understand what are my weaknesses and how to address them.

* Prioritize tasks: as said there are a lot of things to do, also I have a bunch of old tasks that have been piled because of urgencies and those have to be dequeued too. I surely need to understand how many things I have to do and be able to pick the right thing to do at the right time.
* Delegate: from now on (actually it's been like this for quite some time) I won't be able to code as much as I'd like, this means that I'll have to tell other people what to do and how, also about topics that have been my sole responsibility so far, like deployment scripts.
* Mind my own business: when someone asks anything I've always tried to be the one that answers, even when it's a question with no direct addressee. I have to learn to wait for others to answer, mostly if I have other things to do (which always happens). Unless I'm the one mentioned, but even then it's better to redirect the question to someone else that might be able to answer: more time for me, more responsibility (with a possible side effect of more motivation) to others, two birds with one
