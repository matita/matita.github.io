title: Head of Frontend Development
---

The time has come.  
That dreadful time that marked the end of coding in my career.  
I am now the the Head of Frontend Development.

## What does it mean?
I still have to figure it out completely, for sure it means much more things to do, most of them not code related.

Mostly dealing with people, making sure they are motivated and focused on the right things, and ensuring the quality of the products is always high.

## Am I ready?
Yes.  
If I wasn't my employers wouldn't have promoted me.  
Furthermore, it's quite some months that I'm doing kinda the same job, only the name of the position is changed.

## Ok, but am I actually ready?
Weeeeell...  
The impostor sindrome is behind the corner and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.  
For sure there are still a lot of things that I have to learn, but I'm taking it as a new challenge, probably the first real challenge in a while.

I know for a fact that I'm still making mistakes, but I need to understand what are my weaknesses and how to address them.

* Prioritize tasks: as said there are a lot of things to do
