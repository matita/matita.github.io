title: Head of Frontend Development
---

The time has come.  
That dreadful time that marked the end of coding in my career.  
I am now the the Head of Frontend Development.

## What does it mean?
I still have to figure it out completely, for sure it means much more things to do, most of them not code related.

## Am I ready?
Yes.  
If I wasn't my employers wouldn't have promoted me.  
Furthermore, it's quite some months that I'm doing kinda the same job, only the name of the position is changed.

## Ok, but am I actually ready?
Weeeeell...  
The impostor sindrome is behind the corner and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.
