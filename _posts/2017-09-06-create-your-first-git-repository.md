Let's say you're a beginner developer, ora at least you didn't work with any professional team yet.  
You somehow overheard about Git and/or GitHub but never bothered researching what they are and how they can help you.  
So you could have a question on your mind, before deciding .

## Do I really need Git?

If you don't know any other SCM, or don't even know what SCM means, then there is only one valid answer: **YES**.

**TO BE FINISHED** I can give you just a few reasons that should convince you to use it:

* easy to learn
* backup
* code sharing (with your computers or others)
* this is what professionals do

## Install Git on your computer

In order to use GitHub you better have Git installed on your machine, so:

1. Head to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download the installer for your platform
3. Execute the installer
4. If you are on Windows I recommend to select the following options when prompted by the installer (the other options can be left on their default):  
    1. **Use Windows' default console window**
    2. **Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt**
    3. **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings**
