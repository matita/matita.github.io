I finally had some time to work on the Clocks web app I thought about in the previous post.

It is not perfect (yet) as I wanted it to be, but if I'd release it when I think it is perfect I surely won't release it anytime.

And soooo... here it is! [Clocks](https://matita.github.io/clocks)

I wanted it clean and simple, but maybe it is too clean and simple...
Maybe I'll update it with some info and instructions.

Current features are:
- you can search cities to add a new clock
- you can name the clock to identify it with something more specific than the city name (e.g. in my case I'd name it with customer name)
- when you add/rename/delete clocks the URL auto-updates, so you can bookmark it and save your current configuration, or send the link to someone to share your clocks with names
- optimized for mobile

There is still something missing from my original idea:
- it doesn't work offline
- it requests all the informations on every page reload (I wanted it to request mostly once per day to update Daylight Saving Time)

For the development process I'm using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and some [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task to validate and minify the code, but CSS and HTML is still embed in index.html, I plan to use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and some template engine like [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

Hope it is usable and useful for anyone.
